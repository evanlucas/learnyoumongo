Here we will learn how to search for documents.

In this exercise the database name is `learnyoumongo`.
The URL would be something like: `mongodb://localhost:27017/`.

Use the `parrots` collection to find all documents where `age`
is greater than the first argument passed to your script.

Using `console.log`, print the documents to `stdout`.

-----------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To connect to the database, one can use something like this:

```js
var mongo = require('mongodb').MongoClient
mongo.connect(url, function(err, dbConnector) {

  var database = dbConnector.db(database_name);
  //database gives you access to the DB.
})
```

To get a collection, one can use `db.collection('<collection name>')`.

To find a document or documents, one needs to call `find()` on the collection.

Find is a little bit different than what we are used to seeing.

To access the arguments you can use the `process.argv` array of strings (the first argument is stored at the third position `process.argv[2]`). To convert to an integer, you could use parseInt()

Here is an example:

```js
collection.find({
  name: 'foo'
}).toArray(function(err, documents) {

})
```

If your program does not finish executing, you may have forgotten to
close the `db`. That can be done by calling `db.close()` after you
have finished.
