Connect to MongoDB on port `27017`.
You should connect to the database named `learnyoumongo` and insert
a document into the `docs` collection.

The document should be a json document with the following properties:

- `firstName`
- `lastName`

`firstName` will be passed as the first argument to the lesson.

`lastName` will be passed as the second argument to the lesson.

Use `console.log` to print out the object used to create the document.

Make sure you use `JSON.stringify` convert it to JSON.

-----------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

Remember, one can access the arguments passed by using `process.argv`.

In order to use the `mongo` package, one must first require it like:

```js
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
```

To connect, use the `connect()` function of `MongoClient`.

Ex.

```js
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
  if (err) throw err

})
```

If you get a `Connection Refused` error, make sure that `mongod` is still
running.

After you have successfully connected, you will need to specify a collection.
That can be done by calling the `collection()` function on the `db` returned
in the callback to `connect`.

Say you wanted to specify a collection named `users`:

```js
var collection = db.collection('users')
```

To insert a single document, one would need to call `insertOne()` on the collection, like this:
```js

// inserting document
// { a : 2 }
collection.insertOne({
  a: 2
}, function(err, data) {
  // handle error

  // other operations
})
```

If your program does not finish executing, you may have forgotten to
close the `db`. That can be done by calling `db.close()` after you
have finished.
